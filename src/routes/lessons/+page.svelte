    <h3 class="h3">Lyrics Lessons</h3>

    <p class="w-3/4">
        Tail Glow offers lessons in lyrics writing. Just to be clear: I don't teach people how to "write like Tail Glow."
        Most people probably are not interested in writing lyrics the way I do.
    </p>

    <p class="w-3/4">
        What I teach is a comprehensive system on analyzing lyrics and the process of turning ideas into lyrics that will
        actually work for a song. I have written literally hundreds of songs over the past 20 years and commercially released 
        over a hundred of those songs.
        I try to make the lyrics to any songs I release very prominently available, so you can judge for yourself. See the videos
        page on this site for a few examples.

        Email me at <span class="email">tailglowmusic@gmail.com</span> to inquire about timeframes and pricing. I offer a sliding
        scale so tell me a little about yourself and where you are at in your journey.
