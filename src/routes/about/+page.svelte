            My name is Tail Glow and this is the website for my band called Tail Glow. I am the only member of Tail Glow.

            Can I play [instrument] in your band?
        </div>
        
        <p>
            No thank you. If I want another musician to work with me it will only be on a live performance basis
            and they will know because I will be contacting them first and offering them money to play with me.
            Tail Glow is all business, believe it or not. 
        </p>

            I get asked this question constantly and the polite answer
            is "No thanks!" but the real answer is "I don't actually believe that a random person in a bar is a competent
            and reliable enough musician that I'm willing to make complicated logistical plans and take on the liability
            of depending on you without some kind of clearly elucidated contractual terms where each party is entirely
            on the same page and has an equal stake in the success of the enterprise."
        </p>
        <p>
            Not to mention I don't know what kind of crazy political beliefs you have. And you don't know about mine.
            Plus you might just be like a really annoying person, or a complete piece of shit.

            Will you play a show that I'm booking?
        </div>

        <p>
            Maybe! I'm in the South Eastern US so the location and timeframe matter a lot. If it is a weird unusual venue
            like a museum, or an art gallery, or a toy store, or an ice cream parlor, or a house show then the odds are better.
            If you are someone who is trying to make money by acting as a middleman for bands and venues then the answer is
            definitely "No!" and also "You should quit doing that!"
        </p>

        <p>
            If you really would like to see me play somewhere feel free to email me details at <span class="email">tailglowmusic@gmail.com</span>.
            You will find my fee varies a lot based on how genuine I think you are and how interesting it sounds to play there.

            Can I interview you?
        </div>

        <p>
            I'm going to say probably not, but only because most people who have interviewed me in the past were only doing it
            because someone at the publication where they work asked them do so. And I have no interest in doing those kinds of interviews
            ever again.
        </p>

        <p>
            If it's for a weird zine or philosophy-oriented podcast or something then it's more likely. Or if you are just nice and
            genuinely curious about what it is I do. Send an email to <span class="email">tailglowmusic@gmail.com</span>.

            Are you on Social Media?
        </div>

        <p>
            I have an Instagram page under duress. You can follow me under the handle 'tailglowmusic' on there but to be clear
            the only reason I have that account is out of obligation to "promote on social media" whenever someone is nice enough to
            offer me a show to play.
        </p>

        <p>
            I unequivocally think Social Media is horrible and it's not a coincidence that the two biggest social media companies
            are run by racist fascists. I understand how the network effect works but the network effect works because of the habits
            that we form on a daily basis and the unwillingness of people who position themselves as leftists or socially progressive
            to make mild adjustments in their daily routine in order to help wrest control of our society away from actual racist
            fascist billionaires is something I have strong opinions about.
